# SUICIDE RATE PREDICTION

## INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
----

1. Every year, 7,03,000 individuals commit suicide, with many more attempting to commit suicide.
2. Suicide affects people of all ages and was the world's fourth biggest cause of death among 15â€“29-year-olds in 2019. 
3. Suicide is a severe public health issue, but it may be avoided with early, evidence-based, and frequently low-cost treatments. A comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is required for effective national responses.
4. Our current study focuses on projecting suicide rates by examining and finding signals associated with greater suicide rates across diverse socioeconomic groups throughout the world.
